🧠 instructions.md — Wessley Frontend (Next.js + ChatUI + shadcn/ui)
🎯 Mission

You are building the frontend foundation of Wessley AI — an AI-assisted project-car companion that visualizes and manages a car’s electrical system in 3D.

This phase focuses on the Next.js app, preparing a working UI shell that will later connect to:

the backend (for model data, scene logic, etc.), and

the 3D model/scene engine (Three.js or React Three Fiber).

The goal is to produce a fully functional, modular scaffold:

homepage with hero section and dark/light mode

chat interface (ChatUI)

3D scene viewer (placeholder for now)

“scene explorer” panel (component list)

unified visual + interaction system (shadcn + Tailwind + Zustand bus)

The background/hero visuals will be designed later — leave that part blank with proper container placeholders.

🧩 Tech Stack Requirements

Framework: Next.js (App Router, TypeScript, ESLint)

Styling: Tailwind CSS

UI Kit: shadcn/ui (for buttons, cards, sheets, etc.)

Chat Interface: ChatUI (@chatui/core)

State Management: Zustand

Icons: lucide-react

Code Quality: Prettier + Prettier Tailwind plugin

File Aliases: @/*

🏗️ Core Layout Overview
1. Homepage
Section	Description
Hero Header	Contains logo, title (“Meet Wessley”), short description, and CTA “Start Building →”.
3D Scene Window	Placeholder for now. A card container with SceneCanvas that will later load and render a 3D car model.
Chat Window	Uses ChatUI for user interaction, capable of sending textual commands that trigger scene changes (like /focus, /highlight, /view).
Scene Explorer	A small scrollable list showing all electrical components currently in the scene. Each item can be clicked to “focus” on that part.
Top Nav	Contains navigation links: About, Contact, Login, Sign Up.
Theme Toggle	Switch between dark and light modes.

The layout will later evolve into a multi-pane car project dashboard:
Left (explorer), center (3D scene), right (chat/assistant).
For now, we focus on the homepage structure and integration between chat + scene.

🔌 Functional Concepts
A. Scene

Placeholder canvas component (SceneCanvas).

Uses a Zustand bus to receive commands and later communicate with 3D scene logic.

Supports basic commands even before the 3D engine is implemented:

FOCUS → log which component is being focused.

HIGHLIGHT → log highlighted components.

CLEAR_HIGHLIGHT

SET_VIEW

THEME

B. Chat

Implemented using ChatUI.

Initially includes:

A welcome message: “What kind of car are we working on?”

Text input with simple regex parser to detect local “commands” (e.g., /focus battery01).

When commands are recognized, they dispatch messages to the SceneBus.

C. Scene Explorer

Displays a list of mock components.

Clicking on an item triggers a FOCUS command via Zustand.

Will later sync with backend-fetched scene data.

D. Message Bus (Zustand)

Two shared stores:

useSceneBus — manages scene state, components, and dispatch logic.

useChatBus — helper that translates chat tool calls into scene commands.

Purpose:

Enables interaction between Chat → Scene and Scene → Chat without tight coupling.

🧠 Expected Behavior

The SceneCanvas renders a placeholder area (card) that logs incoming scene commands.

The ChatPanel renders ChatUI:

Typing /focus battery01 triggers a SceneBus dispatch with type: "FOCUS".

Typing regular text simply displays the message.

The SceneExplorer shows a mocked list (3–5 example components).

Clicking one sends a focus event to SceneBus.

The layout supports light/dark themes, switchable via theme toggle in the footer/nav.

Everything is modular — future pages (dashboard, about, etc.) can extend the structure.

🎨 Design Notes

Color theme: Matrix green on black (dark) and green on white (light).

Font: Inter or JetBrains Mono (developer-like aesthetic).

Buttons and cards use rounded corners (rounded-2xl), subtle shadows, and modern spacing.

Animations: minimal fade/slide for chat and scene cards.

Keep it sleek and grid-aligned — Wessley’s brand vibe is “tech-garage meets AI companion”.

Directory structure matches spec.

No unhandled errors in console.

🧩 tasks/claude_build — Wessley FE Scaffold (Next.js + ChatUI + shadcn/ui)

Scope: No heavy 3D logic and do not touch hero background styles. Produce a production-grade scaffold for the homepage with a Scene placeholder, ChatUI panel, Scene Explorer, and a unidirectional message bus (Zustand).

Repository assumptions

Monorepo or single repo is fine. If monorepo, app lives at apps/wessley-web.

Node ≥ 18.18, npm ≥ 9.

Git default branch: main.

TASK 2 — Homepage structure (hero + grid zones)

Branch: feat/homepage-hero-grid
Goal: Two-column responsive layout for homepage with placeholders.

Steps:

In /app/page.tsx, add:

Left: Headline (“Meet Wessley.”), subhead (1–2 lines), CTA button (“Start Building →”).

Right: a div container named bg-grid (empty class) reserved for Sahar’s background work (leave styles empty).

Content aligns with screenshots provided.

Class bg-grid exists but has no styles yet.

Commit message:

feat(home): hero left column + reserved bg-grid container (unstyled)


PR title:

TASK 3 — Message bus (Zustand) and types

Branch: feat/bus-types
Goal: Define scene/chat types and shared bus for commands/events (no 3D yet).

Steps:

Create /lib/types/scene.ts and /lib/types/chat.ts:

SceneComponent, SceneCommand (FOCUS, HIGHLIGHT, CLEAR_HIGHLIGHT, SET_VIEW, THEME), SceneEvent.

ChatToolCall, ChatMessage.

Create /lib/bus/useSceneBus.ts:

Holds components: SceneComponent[].

dispatch(cmd: SceneCommand) (no-op for now, logs are OK).

subscribe(fn) to receive SceneEvents.

Create /lib/bus/useChatBus.ts with a helper handleToolCall(call) translating to scene commands.

Acceptance criteria:

Importing bus from any client component is possible.

No circular imports.

Commit message:

TASK 4 — Scene placeholder + Explorer

Branch: feat/scene-explorer
Goal: Add a visual Scene card and an Explorer panel listing components.

Steps:

components/scene/SceneCanvas: Card with fixed height placeholder. Hooks into bus by replacing dispatch with a function that logs commands (to be replaced with 3D engine later).

components/scene/SceneExplorer: Card with title “Scene Explorer”, scrollable list of mock components (3–5 items). Each item has a small “Focus” button that dispatches FOCUS.

Acceptance criteria:

Scene card renders on homepage.

Explorer lists mock items and dispatches on click (visible in console logs).

Fully responsive.

Branch: feat/chatui-panel
Goal: Add ChatUI panel that can send local tool commands to the scene.

Steps:

components/chat/ChatPanel: ChatUI with:

Initial assistant message: “What kind of car are we working on?”

Placeholder input hint: Try /focus BATTERY01 or /view left.

Parse commands using simple syntax:

/focus <id> → FOCUS

/highlight <id id id> → HIGHLIGHT

/view <iso|left|right|front|rear|top> → SET_VIEW

Wire to handleToolCall() → useSceneBus().dispatch(...).

Load ChatPanel client-side only (dynamic import, no SSR) to avoid CSS/DOM issues.

Acceptance criteria:

Typing /focus battery01 yields a console log from SceneCanvas.

Regular messages render as bubbles.

No hydration or CSS warnings in console.

Commit message:

feat(chat): add ChatUI panel with local /focus,/highlight,/view commands -> SceneBus

TASK 6 — Homepage composition (Scene + Chat + Explorer)

Branch: feat/homepage-compose
Goal: Compose the homepage with three sections: Scene, Explorer, Chat.

Steps:

Grid layout:

Desktop: right column stacks Scene (top) + Explorer (below); left column is hero text.

Mobile: hero → Scene → Explorer → Chat (vertical stack).

Place Chat card below Scene/Explorer on mobile and right column on desktop (OK if stacked under Scene for now).

Acceptance criteria:

Layout mirrors the provided mockups (functionally).

All three panels work simultaneously and responsively.

All interactive elements reachable by keyboard; focus styles visible.

Check mobile breakpoints (sm/md/lg) and spacing/borders.

Add aria-labels to buttons (“Focus <name>”, “Send message”, “Theme toggle”).

Lint + typecheck + minimal unit test shell if needed (optional).

Acceptance criteria:

No a11y violations in manual quick pass.

No console errors.

Load fixture into SceneExplorer at mount (no backend calls).

Create README_FE.md describing:

How to run the app

How the bus works

How to add a new scene command

How to connect a real backend later

Add a short Loom/GIF or screenshots to PR.
